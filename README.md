A modern and dynamic **Weather App** built with **React JS**, using the **OpenWeatherMap API** to display real-time weather information based on user-input city names.

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a weather application developed using **React JS**, with additional support from **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **OpenWeather API**. The app allows users to enter any city name and get the current weather conditions instantly. It displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a relevant weather icon (e.g., clouds, rain, snow, drizzle).

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience working with APIs, managing state in React, and creating a user-friendly interface for real-time data interaction.
