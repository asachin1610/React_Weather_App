# 🌦️ React Weather App

A modern and dynamic **Weather App** built with **React JS**, using the **OpenWeatherMap API** to display real-time weather information based on user-input city names.

---

## 📌 Project Description

This project is a weather application developed using **React JS**, with additional support from **HTML**, **CSS**, and the **OpenWeather API**. The app allows users to enter any city name and get the current weather conditions instantly. It displays temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a relevant weather icon (e.g., clouds, rain, snow, drizzle).

The goal of this project was to gain hands-on experience working with APIs, managing state in React, and creating a user-friendly interface for real-time data interaction.

# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
